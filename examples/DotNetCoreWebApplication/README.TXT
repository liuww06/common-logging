This example demonstrates how to configure Common.Logging to log to the debug
window using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration and appsettings.json.
Requires .Net Core (https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

Optional:
You may also see how logging behaves if .Net Core is run on Linux in a Docker
container by following these steps:

1. Install Docker for Windows
   (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
2. Install Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Docker
   (via Tools -> Extensions & Updates menu)
3. Select Docker as the run method for the debugger
